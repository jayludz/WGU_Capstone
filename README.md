A logistic regression model is created to predict fraudulent job advertisements using the Employment Scam Aegean Dataset (EMSCAD), a public dataset of 17,880 job ads collected by researchers at the University of the Aegean in Greece. The project is structured in four parts:

1. The Raw Data folder contains **EMSCAD.csv**, the original EMSCAD that can be downloaded [here](http://emscad.samos.aegean.gr/).
2. The Text Mining folder contains **EMSCAD_text_mining.ipynb**, a Jupyter notebook to perform natural language processing on the job ads in the EMSCAD dataset. The results are saved in **text_mining_results.csv**.
3. The SAS Programs folder contains four SAS programs that were written in SAS Studio:
  - **setup.sas**: sets up a working directory.
  - **data_prep.sas**: prepares the raw EMSCAD for analysis.
  - **visualizations.sas**: generates various data visualizations.
  - **logistic_regression.sas**: creates and evaulates logistic regression model.
4. The Reports folder contains **Executive_Summary.pdf** (a brief summary of the project) and **Capstone_report.pdf** (a more comprehensive account of the project).
